# cordova-plugin-stepper

Lightweight pedometer Cordova/Phonegap plugin for Android using the hardware step sensor, with notifications.

Plugin using the hardware step-sensor for minimal battery consumption. This app is designed to be kept running all the time without having any impact on your battery life! Therefore the app does not drain any additional battery. Unlike other pedometer apps, this app does not track your movement or your location so it doesn't need to turn on your GPS sensor - no impact on your battery.

Plugin does not use prohibited methods for working in the background.
